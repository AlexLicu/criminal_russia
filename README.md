# criminal_russia
Criminal Russia GTA 5 map mod converted for use on FiveM.
Tested on FXserver Linux build 2683 and FXserver Windows build 2683.

Installation:
  1) Copy the criminal_russia folder to your FXserver's resources folder.
  2) Edit your server.cfg file and add "start criminal_russia" to your resources list.
  
Important:
  1) In GTA 5's advanced video settings, set "Extended distance scaling" to medium or higher, or else some props will not load.
  2) If you encounter any frame drops/lag/freezes you should modify the LOD distance of the props using OpenIV/Codewalker or any text editor.
  3) This version only features 1 LOD and little to none vegetation.

  I only fixed some "Poly edge" & "Physics validation failed" errors for the props presesnting these issues and made it possible to load this map on a FiveM FXserver.
